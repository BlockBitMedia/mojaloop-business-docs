This repository contains a set of templates for business documents.These are intended as guidance to businesses or agencies who are
evaluating the creation of a real-time retail payment system, enabled by Mojaloop open source software. The documents are likely more
broadly useful than that, though they were created to complement and guide the practical application of the Mojaloop software.
