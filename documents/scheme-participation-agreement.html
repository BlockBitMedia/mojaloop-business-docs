<h2 id="about-the-mojaloop-community-business-document-project"><strong>About the Mojaloop Community Business Document Project</strong></h2>
<p>This document is part of the Mojaloop Community Business Document Project. The project is intended to support entities (countries, regions, associations of providers or commercial enterprises) implementing new payments systems using Mojaloop code. These entities will also need write Business Rules that participants in the system will follow.</p>
<p>The Mojaloop Community Business Document Project provides templates for Business Rules and related documents. There are many choices involved in implementing a new payment system: the templates show some of the choices and, where appropriate, commentary is provided on how the particular choice is related to the goals of a Level One aligned system.</p>
<p>The following documents are part of the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scheme Key Choices</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scheme Participation Agreement Template</p>

<li><p>Scheme Business Rules Template</p>
