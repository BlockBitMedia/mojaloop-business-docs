These entities will also need write Business Rules that participants in the system will follow.\nThe Mojaloop Community Business Document Project provides templates for Business Rules and related documents. There are many choices involved in implementing a new payment system: the templates show some of the choices and, where appropriate, commentary is provided on how the particular choice is related to the goals of a Level One aligned system.\nThe following documents are part of the project:\n\nScheme Key Choices\n\nScheme Participation Agreement Template\n\nScheme Business Rules Template\n\nPlatform Operating Guideline Template\n\nException Management Operating Guideline Template\n\nUniform Glossary\n\n\nIntroduction\nA Scheme implementing a Level One aligned system, including those using Mojaloop reference code in the platform, will need to write Business Rules for the Scheme. A template for those Business Rules is included in this project. The Business Rules introduce the concept of Associated Documents, which are part of the Business Rules and have the same force -- DFSPs signing the Business Rules are also bound to follow provisions in Associated Documents.\nThe Platform Operating Guideline is an important Associated Document that describes how the Scheme Platform will operate, and specifies the obligations and responsibilities of the Scheme, the Platform Operator, and the DFSPs.\nThis document is a template for such a Platform Operating Guideline. Many provisions in it, however, will vary depending on what choices the Scheme has made: some of these choices are described in the \"Scheme Key Choices\" document which is a part of this project.\nThe Business Rules template that is part of this project can be used independent of a scheme's choice of platform. This Platform Operating Guideline is more specific to the use of Mojaloop as a platform.\nTable of Contents -- Platform Operating Guideline Template\n1 - About This Document\n1.1 - Scheme Services\n1.2 - Open API Specification\n1.3 - Scheme Use Cases\n1.4 - Scheme Supported Identifiers\n2 - The Account Lookup Service\n2.1 - Description of the Account Lookup Service\n2.2 - Party Request\n2.3 - Parties Query\n2.4 - Parties Query Response\n3 - The Quote Service\n3.1 - Description of the Quote Service\n3.2 - Quote Request\n3.3 - Quote Response\n4 - The Transfer Service\n4.1 - Description of the Transfer Service\n4.2 - Transfer Request\n4.3 - Request to Pay\n5 - The Settlement Service\n5.1 - Transfer Settlement\n5.2 - Fee Settlement: Processing Fees\n5.3 - Fee Settlement: Interchange Fees\n6 - The Scheme Management Service\n6.1 - Description of the Scheme Management Service\n6.2 - The Registration Process\n6.3 - DFSP Customer Service\n6.4 - Scheme System Management\n7 - The Fraud Management Service\n8 - Appendix: Scheme Supported Use Cases and System Parameters\n9 - Appendix: Merchant Category Codes\n1. About This Document\nThese Platform Operating Guidelines specify operational and technical requirements for DFSPs and for the Scheme. From time to time the Scheme will issue additional Operational Bulletins, which will describe additional operational features of the Scheme and specify additional requirements of DFSPs.\n1.1 Scheme Services\n\nScheme Services are used by DFSPs to exchange interoperable transactions, and to manage their involvement with the Scheme.\n\nThe Scheme Account Lookup Service enables DFSPs in the system to identify the DFSP who manages the Transaction Account for an intended Payee or other counterparty to a Transfer.\n\nThe Scheme Transfer Service enables a Payer DFSP to send a Transfer to a Payee DFSP, thereby effecting a transfer of funds from a Payer to a Payee.\n\nThe Scheme Settlement Service enables DFSPs to settle their financial obligations to the Scheme with respect to Transfers.\n\nThe Scheme Management Service enables the Scheme to grant and revoke access to Scheme by DFSPs, manages the ongoing interactions of DFSPs with Scheme, monitors the effective operation of Scheme, and provides tools for DFSPs to manage their involvement with Scheme.\n\nThe Scheme Fraud Management Service enables DFSPs to collaborate on certain elements of fraud management in order to reduce costs and improve results.\n\nDFSPs are required to follow the procedures detailed below for using Scheme.\n\n\n1.2 Open API Specification\nScheme protocols are based on the operational and data models defined in the specifications document \"Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification\" version 1.0 dated [xx]. Where the Scheme departs from this specification, such departures are documented here and will supersede the relevant sections of that document. The Scheme may update the version used by issuing an Operational Bulletin.\n1.3 Scheme Use Cases\nSome rules and operational specifications vary by Use Cases and Secondary Use Cases supported by Scheme. Scheme recognizes Use Cases and Secondary Use Cases by a combination of required data components and system inference. This is detailed in an Appendix to this document.\n1.4 Scheme Supported Identifiers\nThe Scheme supports certain Identifiers, or payment addresses, for use in making Transfers. The Identifier identifies the Payee whose Transaction Account is credited for the Transfer. Supported Scheme Identifiers are listed in an Appendix to the Business Rules.\nFor each scheme supported identifier, this document should specify what the identifier is and how it is resolved (how it is determined which Payee DFSP is responsible for the transaction account associated with that identifier.\n1.4.1 Example: The MSISDN Identifier\nEach scheme will have its own guidelines for each identifier; the provisions below could vary significantly depending on choices made.\n\nMSISDN's are mobile numbers which are globally unique. MSISDN's are the Transaction Account Identifier for DFPSs who are Mobile Network Operators and who are providing Transaction Accounts to their customers.\n\nUse of the MSISDN as a Payee Identifier is limited to Transaction Accounts provided by DFSPs who are the Mobile Network Operator responsible for that MSISDN.\n  Note: if MSISDN's are used for other Transaction Accounts, they are\naliases, and a separate protocol for resolving them must be specified.\n\nA Party Request for an MSISDN is resolved by a MSISDN directory service determined by the Scheme. The Scheme may specify directory service maintenance obligations for Mobile Network Operator DFSPs from time to time.\n\n\n1.4.2 Example: The Bank Account Number Identifier\nEach scheme will have its own guidelines for each identifier; the provisions below could vary significantly depending on choices made.\n\nBank Account numbers are assigned to customers by Bank DFSPs who are providing Transaction Accounts to their customers.\n\nThe Bank Account Number, together with a Bank Code, form the Scheme Bank Account Number Identifier. Payer DFSPs are responsible for correctly formatting the Bank Account Number Identifier according to formats that will be specified by the Scheme.\n\nUse of the Bank Account Number Identifier is limited to Transaction Accounts which are provided by DFSPs who are Banks.\n\nA Party Request for a Bank Account Identifier is sent by the Payer DFSP to Scheme. Scheme checks that the Bank Code in the Bank Account Identifier is associated with a Bank active in Scheme.\n\n\n1.4.3 Example: The Scheme Merchant Identifier\nEach scheme will have its own guidelines for each identifier; the provisions below could vary significantly depending on choices made.\n\nThe Merchant ID is a Scheme-defined identifier used for person-to-business payments.\n\nUse of the Merchant ID is limited to DFSPs who are providing Transaction Accounts to merchants, billers, government agencies or other enterprise entities who are receiving payments from their customers over Scheme. It may be used for both in-person and remote payments. The term \"merchant\" used in this section includes all of these types of receivers of payments.\n\nUse of the Merchant ID is limited to Transfers of the P2B or P2G Use Cases\n\nA merchant may request multiple merchant IDs from their DFSP; these may be used by the merchant for different outlets, tills, or stores. There is no limit to the number of merchant IDs that can be linked to a single Transaction Account. A given merchant ID, however, may only be linked to a single Transaction Account.\n\nThe Merchant ID is issued by Scheme to the DFSP who is providing the merchant with the Transaction Account into which payments will be made.\n\nThe Merchant ID is issued as a number, which may be displayed by a merchant physically or digitally.\n\nMerchant ID's may be rendered as QR codes by DFSPs or their merchant customers. QR codes must be rendered under format and brand guidelines that will be issued by the Scheme. DFSPs are prohibited from using other QR code data formats or brands to receive payments through Scheme.\n\nDFSPs are required to display Scheme branding. Scheme brand requirements will be specified by the Scheme. Scheme branding must be visible to the customer in the merchant store, or on the device the paying customer is using to purchase remotely.\n\nRegistration Requirements. DFSPs will request a Merchant ID for a customer using a Scheme API specific to this purpose. DFSPs will be required to provide:\n\nDFSP ID\n\nThe Transaction Account number which will receive the funds paid to the merchant. This may be either an MSISDN or a bank account number.\n\nThe [business registration or tax ID] of the merchant. Any number of merchant IDs may be associated with the same business registration or tax ID.\n\nThe Merchant Name\n\n\n\nDFSPs requesting a Merchant ID from Scheme warrant that they have completed the required KYC information for the merchant account at the time of the request.\n\nDFSPs are required to provide adequate training information to their customers.\n\nDisabling Merchant IDs. DFSPs may request that a Merchant ID be disabled. Scheme will immediately disable this Merchant ID, but will retain it in the Scheme system for reporting purposes. Quote Requests or Transfer Requests made to this Merchant ID will be refused by Scheme and returned the Payer DFSP.\n\n\nThe Scheme may wish to provide some mechanism for porting a Merchant ID from one DFSP to another.\n1.4.4 The Scheme ID Identifier\nThis ID would be similar to the Merchant ID above but would be meant for consumers as well as businesses, and could be expressed in phrases rather than as a number. Note each scheme will have its own guidelines for each identifier; the provisions below could vary significantly depending on choices made.\n\nThe Scheme ID is a Scheme-defined identifier.\n\nDFSPs are required to offer their customers the option of requesting a Scheme ID.\n\nScheme IDs can be in any form, subject only to restrictions of length which Scheme will specify from time to time. Scheme reserves the right to refuse the use of any specific requested Scheme ID.\n\n\nSchemes may wish to enable Scheme ID's\n\nCustomers may request any number of Scheme IDs, subject to limits imposed by their DFSP. Multiple Scheme IDs can be associated with a single Transaction Account. Each Scheme ID, however, can be associated with only a single Transaction Account.\n\nRegistration Requirements. DFSPs will request a Scheme ID for a customer using a Scheme API specific to this purpose. DFSPs will be required to provide in this API:\n\nDFSP ID\n\nThe requested Scheme ID\n\nThe Transaction Account number which will receive the funds paid to the customer. This may be either an MSISDN or a bank account number.\n\nIf the Transaction Account Holder is a merchant or business, the [business registration or tax ID] of the Account Holder. Any number of Scheme IDs may be associated with the same business registration or tax ID.\n\n\n\nDFSPs requesting a Scheme ID from Scheme warrant that they have completed the required KYC information for the customer account at the time of the request.\n\nDisabling Scheme Identifiers. DFSPs may request that a Scheme ID be disabled. Scheme will immediately disable this Scheme ID, but will retain it in the Scheme system for reporting purposes. Quote Requests or Transfer Requests made to this Scheme ID will be refused by Scheme and returned to the Payer DFSP.\n\n\nThe Scheme may wish to provide some mechanism for porting a Scheme ID from one DFSP to another.\nThe following sections describe each service and the obligations and responsibilities of stakeholders. Each service consists of processes: most of the processes are linked to specific API calls specified in the \"Open API Specification\" section of this document.\n2.The Account Lookup Service\n2.1 Description of the Account Lookup Service\n\nThe Account Lookup Service allows DFSPs to map specific Identifiers for individual customers to the DFSP that provides a Transaction Account for that customer. Identifiers are used to identify individuals, merchants, billers, government agencies or other enterprises. Any Identifier Type supported by Scheme has a defined Identifier Service, the parameters of which are shown in the section \"Scheme Supported Identifiers\" of this document.\n\nAll Identifier Services ensure that Identifiers used for Scheme Transactions are unique within Scheme and are associated with a single DFSP who provides the relevant Transaction Account for that customer. Any Identifier must be associated with a single Transaction Account.\n\nDFSPs must complete the Account Lookup process immediately before initiating a Quote process unless otherwise permitted in these Guidelines.\n\n\n2.2 Party Request\n\nA Party Request is sent by a Payer DFSP to the Platform. The Party Request must contain the following key data elements:\n\nThe Identifier for the intended Payee\n\nThe Payer DFSP identifier\n\n\n\n\nThe scheme may define additional key data elements which will be required in the Parties Request.\n\nThe request is forwarded from the Platform to the Account Lookup Service for that Identifier type.\n\nThe Identifier Service returns to the Account Lookup Service the identification of the DFSP associated with that Identifier, if a reference is found. If it is not, a negative response is returned and this is communicated by the Platform to the Payer DFSP. If a reference is found, the Account Lookup Service then associates the identified DFSP with the correct Scheme DFSP ID.\n\n\n2.3 Parties Query\n\nIf the Party Request succeeds in identifying a Payee DFSP, the Platform then executes a Parties Query to the identified DFSP to determine if the DFSP is willing to accept a Quote Request directed to that Identifier.\n\n2.4 Parties Query Response\n\nThe identified DFSP responds either with a positive Parties Query Response or with an error response. If positive, the Parties Query Response must contain the following key data elements:\n\nThe full Name of the Payee\n\nThe Payer DFSP Identifier\n\nThe Transaction Account Type, which specifies whether the Account is a bank account or a wallet\n\nThe Transaction Account Holder Type, which specifies whether the Transaction Account Holder is a consumer, a merchant (including other enterprise types) or a government agency.\n\nIf the Payee is a Merchant, the Merchant Category Code. These codes are found in an appendix to this document.\n\n\n\n\nThe scheme may define additional data elements required in the Parties Query Response.\n\nThe Platform responds to the Payer DFSP with the result of the Parties Query Response\n\n3. The Quote Service\n3.1 Description of the Quote Service\n\nThe Quote Process precedes the Transfer Process, and allows the Payer and Payee DFSP to exchange certain information prior to the Transfer.\n\nThe Quote Process must be completed before a Payer DFSP initiates the Transfer Process. This is true for all Use Cases and Secondary Use Cases.\n\nThe steps in the Quote Process are shown below.\n\n\n3.2 Quote Request\n\nA Quote Request is sent by a Payer DFSP to the Payee DFSP; the Quote Request is recorded by the Platform. The Quote Request must contain the following key data elements:\n\nThe Transfer Amount\n\nThe Amount Type set as a Send Amount.\n\nThe complete set of Party Information that was returned from the Parties Request Response.\n\nThe Full Name of the Payer (the Transaction Account Holder at the Payer DFSP)\n\nTransaction Type data required for the Use Case and Secondary Use Case of the Transaction, as specified in the Use Case Appendix to this document.\n\nAn expiry time, the allowable parameters of which will be specified by the scheme from time to time.\n\n\n\n\nThe scheme may define additional key data elements which will be required in the Parties Query Response.\n\nA Quote Request for an amount above the Scheme Transaction Value Limit will be rejected by the Platform and returned to the Payer DFSP.\n\n3.3 Quote Response\n\nA Quote Response is sent by the Payee DFSP to the Payer DFSP; the Quote Response is recorded by the Platform. The Payee DFSP is required to respond to a Quote Request.\n\nThe Quote Response must contain the following key data elements:\n\nThe Transfer Amount\n\nAn expiry time, the allowable parameters of which will be specified by the Scheme from time to time.\n\nThe signed Transaction Object which contains the parameters of the transfer. The Transaction Object is the authoritative description of the transaction for the purposes of Scheme reporting, fraud management and dispute resolution.\n\n\n\n\nThe scheme may define additional key data elements which will be required in the Parties Query Response.\n\nThe Quote Response is signed by the Payee DFSP and defines the parameters of the Transaction; the Payer DFSP cannot change these parameters in the Transfer Process.\n\n4. The Transfer Service\n4.1 Description of the Transfer Service\n\nThe Transfer Service is the means by which the actual transfer of funds is accomplished between Payer DFSP and Payee DFSP. The Transfer Request is the key process within the service. A Transfer Request must be preceded by a Quote process.\n\n4.2 Transfer Request\n\nA Transfer Request is sent by a Payer DFSP to the Payee DFSP via the Transfer Service at Scheme. The Platform records the Transfer Request. The Transfer Request must contain the following key data elements:\n\nThe Payer and Payee DFSP Identifiers\n\nThe Transaction Amount\n\nAn ILP packet representing the Transaction Object\n\nAn expiry time, the allowable parameters of which will be specified by the Scheme from time to time.\n\n\n\n\nThe scheme may define additional key data elements which will be required in the Transfer Request.\n\nThe Transfer Request is signed by the Payer DFSP\n\nThe Platform performs a Transfer Approval process to determine if the proposed Transfer can be settled. The Transfer Approval process is further defined in the Settlement Service section of this document.\n\nIf the Transfer Request fails the Transfer Approval process, the Transfer Request is returned to the Payer DFSP.\n\nIf the Transfer Request passes the Transfer Approval process, the Platform reserves the funds specified in the Transfer Request in the Payer DFSP's Position Ledger. This is further defined in the Settlement Service section of this document.\n\nThe Payee DFSP determines if they will accept the Transfer.\n\nIf not accepted, an error response is returned to the Platform. The Platform releases the reservation of funds in the Payer DFSP's Position Ledger and returns an error condition to the Payer DFSP.\n\nIf accepted, the Payee DFSP returns a signed Transfer Response indicating that the Transfer has been Fulfilled. The Platform replaces the provisional debit with a debit in the Payer DFSP's Position Ledger and credits the Payee's DFSP's Position Ledger with a credit in the amount of the Transfer.\n\nThe Platform then sends a confirmation of the fulfilled Transfer to the Payer DFSP and to the Payee DFSP.\n\nIf the Platform does not receive a signed Transfer Response within the expiry period in the Transfer Request, the transfer will be cancelled and Scheme will notify the Payee and Payer DFSPs of this.\n\nPayer and Payee DFSPs are required:\n\nTo notify their customers of the status of a transfer on a timely basis\n\nTo immediately debit and credit the Transaction Accounts of their customers upon fulfillment of the Transfer\n\nTo release any reserved funds immediately if a Transfer has been refused or cancelled\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Request to Pay\nThis section has not yet been written.\n5. The Settlement Service\nThis document presents a template for the settlement processes both for transfers and for scheme fees. There are multiple possible approaches to settlement, which are discussed in the \"Key Choices\" document that is part of this project. The template below covers two models: net settlement and continuous gross settlement. Mojaloop reference code supports a number of different settlement models, including these.\n5.1 Transfer Settlement\n5.1.1 Description of the Transfer Settlement Service\n\nTransfer Settlement is the means by which DFSPs settle their financial obligations to each other. There are five processes to Transfer Settlement: the Ledger Process, the Net Debit Cap Process, the Transfer Approval Process, the Settlement Posting Process and\nthe Settlement Account Management Process.\n\n[Net settlement option] DFSPs are required to open a Settlement Bank account with the Scheme Settlement Bank. [Continuous gross settlement option] DFSPs are required to become joint owners of the Scheme Pooled Settlement bank account at the Scheme Settlement Bank, and to use or open such other individual bank accounts at the Scheme Settlement Bank as necessary to transfer funds into and out of the Scheme Pooled Settlement bank account.\n\n\n5.1.2 The Platform Ledger\n\nThe Platform is responsible for maintaining a DFSP Position Ledger for each DFSP. This operation runs on a continual basis. [Continuous gross settlement option] The DFSP Position Ledger of each DFSP, less any provisional entries, represents the ownership share of that DFSP in the Scheme Pooled Settlement Bank Account.\n\nThe Position Ledger records:\n\nAll Fulfilled Transfer as debits to the Payer DFSP's ledger and credits to the Payee DFSP's ledger\n\nAll Transfer Requests as provisional debits to the Payer DFSP's ledger. These provisional debits are removed when the Transfer is Fulfilled, refused by the Payee DFSP, or expires.\n\n[Net settlement option only] Settlement Entries delivered to and accepted by the Scheme Settlement Bank for that DFSP.\n\n[Continuous gross settlement option only] Transfers into and out of the Scheme Pooled Settlement Bank account made by DFSPs.\n\n\n\nThe DFSP Ledger Position is the sum of all of the items listed above. This is used in the Transfer Approval Process.\n\n\n5.1.3 Net Debit Cap Process\n\nThe Net Debit Cap for a DFSP is a value that the Platform uses during the Transfer Approval Process. The Net Debit for a DFSP is the sum of:\n\n[Net Settlement Option only] A value set by the scheme that is intended to represent the funds the DFSP has available in its Settlement Bank Account\n\n\n\nNote the scheme may be able to automate the calculation of value described above, or it may choose to manually input this into the Platform Operator section of the Scheme Portal.\n\nThe Scheme Margin for that DFSP. This is a value, determined by the Scheme, that is specific to a given DFSP. This value may be a percentage of the DFSP Ledger Position or it may be an absolute value. The Scheme may change the Scheme Margin for any DFSP at its discretion. It may have the effect of either increasing or decreasing a DFSP's ability to execute transactions.\n\nThe DFSP Discretionary Margin. This is a value, determined by an individual DFSP, which lowers the absolute value of the Net Debit Cap. The DFSP Discretionary Margin is set within allowable parameters defined by the Scheme. This has the effect of decreasing the DFSP's ability to execute transactions.\n\n\n5.1.4 Transfer Approval Process\n\nTransfer Approval. When the Platform receives a Transfer Request from a Payer DFSP, the Platform will approve or reject the request based on a comparison of the amount of the requested transfer to the Payer DFSP's Current Ledger Position less the Payer DFSP's Net Debit Cap.\n\nIf the requested transfer is less this sum, the Platform will forward the request to the Payee DFSP. If it is more than the value of the Net Debit Cap, the Platform will reject the request and return it to the Payer DFSP.\n\n\n5.1.5 Settlement Posting Process\n\n[Net settlement option only] The scheme will define the parameters of the Settlement Windows used for the scheme; this will include the frequency of windows or other parameters (value limits, etc.) chosen for defining settlement windows.\n\n[Net settlement option only] At the end of each defined settlement window, the Platform will calculate the net settlement position of every DFSP: this position is the balance in the DFSP Position Ledger. These balances become the Settlement Entries for that window.\n\n[Net settlement option only] The Platform will send Settlement Entries for each DFSP to the scheme-chosen Settlement Bank\n\n[Net settlement option only] The Settlement Bank will post Settlement Entries to the Settlement Bank Account of each DFSP, and send confirmation to the Platform of the completion of this process.\n\n\nScheme rules will need to account for provisions and procedures in the event of a failure of the process described above.\n5.1.6 Settlement Account Management Process\n\n[Net settlement option] DFSPs may add funds to their Scheme Settlement Bank Account at their discretion. The Scheme will provide instructions on how to do this. [Continuous Gross settlement option] DFSPs may transfer funds into the Scheme Pooled Settlement Bank Account at their discretion. The Scheme will provide instruction on how to do this.\n\n[Continuous Gross Settlement option only] The Scheme will provide and end-of-day report to DFSPs showing their share of ownership in the Scheme Pooled Settlement Bank Account.\n\nDFSPs may request withdrawal of funds from their [Net settlement option] Settlement Bank Account through the Scheme Portal [Continuous gross settlement option] DFSPs may request withdrawal of funds from the Scheme Pooled Settlement Bank Account through the Scheme Portal. The scheme will review the requested withdrawal, and, if approved, execute the transfer on behalf of the DFSP. The purpose of this review is to ensure that a DFSP's share of the Settlement Bank Account is sufficient to support Transfers in process: this approval will not be unreasonably denied.\n\n\n5.1.7 Scheme Settlement Reporting\n\nThe scheme will provide, through the Scheme DFSP Portal, information for DFSPs which includes for each DFSP:\n\nThe current Net Debit Cap and its components\n\nThe current Ledger Position and its components, including Fulfilled Transfers for all DFPSs and Provisional Transfers for Payer DFSPs\n\nAlerts at certain levels of the Current Ledger Position: these levels to be determined by the DFSPS and/or the Scheme from time to time\n\n\n\nTools to enable DFSPs to forecast their anticipated transfer volume based on historical data\n\n\n5.2 Fee Settlement: Processing Fees\nThis section is not yet written\n5.3 Fee Settlement: Interchange Fees\nThis section is not yet written\n6. The Scheme Management Service\nNote: there is a parallel Platform Operator Service that is necessary for the operation of the platform which is not described in this document.\n6.1 Description of the Scheme Management Service\n\nThe Scheme Management Service is provided by the Scheme to assist DFSPs in their use of Scheme Services. Many of these functions are provided through the Scheme Portal, which is made available to Scheme DFSPs.\n\nThe following processes are part of the Scheme Management Service:\n\n\n6.2 The Registration Process\n\nThe Registration Process enables DFSP application for participation and for operational and technical on-boarding. It covers the following areas:\n\nForms and processes for DFSP application for Participation in Scheme.\n\nForms and processes for obtaining digital certificates and digital signatures for use with the Platform.\n\nProcesses for downloading Scheme-provided software artifacts including SDKs and APIs.\n\nProcesses for testing technical readiness to access the Platform and Services.\n\nProcesses for receiving Scheme approval and certification for accessing the Platform and Services.\n\n\n\n\n6.3 DFSP Customer Service\n\nThe scheme will provide both an online and a telephone help desk for DFSPs.\n\nThe Scheme Portal will provide means by which DFSPs can designate Portal administrators and users, and update DFSP Profile information.\n\n\n6.4 Scheme System Management\n\nThe scheme will provide, through the Scheme Portal, means by which DFSPs can see their current Position Ledger, their Net Debit Cap, and their recent and historical activity with Scheme.\n\nThe scheme will provide, through the Scheme Portal, means by which DFSPs can use historical data, including their Positions and Net Debit Cap histories, to forecast upcoming volumes and required settlement funding levels.\n\nThe scheme will provide means by which DFSPs can obtain updates to software artifacts that they have previously downloaded.\n\nThe scheme will provide, through the Scheme Portal, means by which DFSPs can request a withdrawal from their share of the Scheme Settlement Bank Account.\n\nThe scheme will provide, through the Scheme Portal, means by which DFSPs can view their share of the balance in the Scheme Settlement Bank Account.\n\n\n7. The Fraud Management Service\nThis section has not yet been written, but is expected to include the\nfollowing sections:\n\nDescription of the Fraud Management Utility -- Purpose and Scope\n\nThe Shared Transaction Database\n\nFraud Categorization Scheme\n\nReporting of Known Bad Actors or Transactions\n\nAnomaly and Fraud Detection Algorithms and Processes\n\nDFSP Reporting\n\nReal-time Transaction Interception Options\n\nAppendix: Scheme Supported Use Cases and System Parameters\n\n\nThis is the same table as appears in the Business Rules document, but it has added the systemic codes necessary for the Platform to recognize a transaction as belonging to a given use case or secondary use case. A scheme would only define Secondary Use Cases if it wanted to write rules and/or specify fees that are unique to that Secondary Use Case\nThis table is an example of a table of Use Cases and Secondary Use Cases that a scheme might support.\n\n\n\nUse Case Code\nUse Case\nSecondary User Case\nRequired Data Elements\nOther Methods of Use Case Determination\n\n\n\n\n1.0\nP2P\nPerson to Person\nAPI Setting Scenario=Transfer Initiator = Payer Initiator Type = Consumer Recipient Type = Consumer\n\n\n\n1.1\nP2P\nWallet to wallet\nTransaction Account Type for Payer DFSP is Wallet and for Payee DFSP is Wallet\n\n\n1.2\nP2P\nBank to bank\nTransaction Account Type for Payer DFSP is Bank and for Payee DFSP is Wallet\n\n\n1.3\nP2P\nWallet to bank\nTransaction Account Type for Payer DFSP is Wallet and for Payee DFSP is Bank\n\n\n1.4\nP2P\nBank to Wallet\nTransaction Account Type for Payer DFSP is Bank and for Payee DFSP is Wallet.\n\n\n2.0\nBulk Payment\n\nAPI Settings Scenario=Transfer Initiator = Payer Recipient Type = Consumer\n\n\n2.1\nB2P\nBank to bank\nInitiator Type = Business\n\n\n2.2\nG2P\nGovernment to Person\nInitiator Type = Government\n\n\n3.0\nP2B\nPerson to Business\nAPI Settings Scenario=Transfer Initiator = Payer Initiator Type = Consumer Recipient Type = Business\n\n\n3.1\nP2B\nTill Number Purchase\nInitiator Type = Device\n\n\n\n3.2\nP2B\nQR code Purchase\ntbd\n\n\n\n3.3\nP2B\nOnline Purchase\nMerchant ID Code = tbd\n\n\n\n3.4\nP2B\nBill Payment\n\ntbd: a data element in the Quote Request will include the Payerâ€™s account number at the biller\n\n\n3.5\nP2B\nPerson to Business - Other\n\n\n\n\n4.0\nP2G\n\nAPI Settings Scenario=Transfer Initiator = Payer Recipient Type = Government\n\n\n4.1\nP2G\nPerson to Government\n\n\n\n\n4.1\nP2G\nTill Number Purchase\nInitiator Type = Device\n\n\n\n4.2\nP2G\nQR code Purchase\ntbd\n\n\n\n4.3\nP2G\nOnline Purchase\nMerchant ID Code = tbd\n\n\n\n4.4\nP2G\nBill Payment\n\ntbd: a data element in the Quote Request will include the Payerâ€™s account number at the biller\n\n\n\n9. Appendix: Merchant Category Codes\nThe scheme will want to specify codes to recognize the type of merchant being paid. The term \"merchant\" here is used broadly to include all types of non-consumer payments acceptors. A merchant category code scheme might want to recognize industries, domains (in-person stores vs remote or online) and/or merchant size.\n"},"documents/scheme-business-rules.html":{"url":"documents/scheme-business-rules.html","title":"Scheme Business Rules","keywords":"","body":"Scheme Business Rules Template\n\n\n\nVersion\nAuthor\nDate\nChange Description\n\n\n\n\n4.0\nCarol Coye Benson (Glenbrook)\nOctober 2019\n\n\n\nAbout the Mojaloop Community Business Document Project\nThis document is part of the Mojaloop Community Business Document Project. The project is intended to support entities (countries, regions, associations of providers or commercial enterprises) implementing new payments systems using Mojaloop code. These entities will also need write Business Rules that participants in the system will follow.\nThe Mojaloop Community Business Document Project provides templates for Business Rules and related documents. There are many choices involved in implementing a new payment system: the templates show some of the choices and, where appropriate, commentary is provided on how the particular choice is related to the goals of a Level One aligned system.\nThe following documents are part of the project:\n\nScheme Key Choices\n\nScheme Participation Agreement Template\n\nScheme Business Rules Template\n\nPlatform Operating Guideline Template\n\nException Management Operating Guideline Template\n\nUniform Glossary\n\n\nIntroduction\nPayments Schemes around the world are in the process of implementation, or considering implementation, of Mojaloop-based payments systems. Mojaloop is open-source software for financial services companies, government regulators, and others taking on the challenges of interoperability and financial inclusion. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has provided funding and support for Mojaloop through The Level One Project, a vision for digital financial markets based on principles of interoperability, collaboration, and inclusion.\nSchemes implementing Mojaloop will need to write Business Rules which govern the rights and responsibilities of participants in the system. This document provides a template for those Business Rules. The template is structured as a detailed outline: the actual wording of rules will be determined by implementing Schemes and the jurisdictions within which they operate. In many parts of the document, we simply suggest a topic which a Scheme might want to consider writing a rule about: again, the specifics of the rule will vary by Scheme.\nBefore Business Rules are written, Schemes need to make major business decisions about how the system and its ecosystem partners will work. These decisions are described in a separate document within the Mojaloop Community Business Document Project, \"Scheme Key Choices\". People are encouraged to read that document first.\nScheme Business Rules Template\nTable of Contents\n1 - About These Scheme Business Rules\n2 - Scheme Goals\n3 - Participation in Scheme\n4 - Scheme Business Rules\n5 - Responsibilities and Obligations of the Scheme\n6 - Participant Responsibilities and Obligations of Participants\n7 - Liability - Allocation of Responsibilities\n8 - Security, Risk Management, and Data Confidentiality\n9 - Scheme Platform and Services\n10 - Exception Management\n11 - Appendix: Associated Documents\n12 - Appendix: Onboarding and Exit Processes\n13 - Appendix: Scheme Services\n14 - Appendix: Scheme Supported Use Cases\n15 - Appendix: Scheme Fee Schedule\n16 - Appendix: Risk Management, Security, Privacy, and Service Standards\nA Guide to This Document\nSection Headings and bulleted entries underneath section headings are actual proposed wording, or suggested sections for a rules document. Text in italics are comments which can be used when a scheme drafts the actual language of a rules document.\n1. About These Scheme Business Rules\n1.1 These are the Scheme Business Rules.\nNote that the Mojaloop software can be used for bilateral exchanges among DFSPs, as well as within a Scheme structure that uses a switch. This document assumes the latter; that the Scheme is either providing, hiring, or otherwise arranging that interoperable transactions are exchanged through a switch. Some of the concepts in these rules apply only to this configuration; others would be useful in bilateral agreements as well.\n\n1.2 Scheme Ownership\nWho owns the scheme, what opportunities exist for ownership participation. Reference to other documents (charter, by-laws, etc.)\n\n1.3 Defined Associated Documents\n\nThese rules include the Associated Documents listed in an Appendix to these rules. Associated Documents are part of, and have the force of, the Operating Rules.\n\nAssociated Documents should include the Platform Operating Guideline and the Uniform Glossary. This does not include various technical documents that may be referenced in the Business Rules or the Platform Operating Guideline.\n\n1.4 Scheme Business Rules are Binding on Participants\nThis repeats the provision in the Scheme Participation Agreement. Note that Scheme Business Rules are only binding on the DFSPs that participate in the Scheme. The Scheme may write rules that require certain provisions of these rules be passed on to Participant customers (for example, merchants) or partners (for example, processors) - but this is an obligation of the Participant to the Scheme, not the other parties.\n\n1.5 Rules May Be Amended\nDetails of amendment process are specified elsewhere.\n\n1.6 Terms are Defined in Uniform Glossary\nThe glossary is a separate document, rather than be internal to the Business Rules document. This is to ensure consistency in terminology as the service evolves and the Platform Operating Guideline changes.\n\n2. Scheme Goals\nThis is a section that allows a Scheme to state the objectives of the Scheme. We suggest support of interoperable financial transactions, financial inclusion, and gender equality. This is also an opportunity to reference support for the Level One Project Design Principles, a national or regional payments strategy (or digital economy strategy), or a Scheme-specific set of design principles.\n\n3. Participation in Scheme\n3.1 Participation Eligibility\n\nEligibility Criteria\n\nA statement as to which types of institutions are eligible to apply to be a participant in the Scheme. The Level One design principle is that any licensed provider of transaction accounts in a jurisdiction covered by the Scheme should be eligible to apply\n\n\nApproval Criteria\n\nScheme provisions for acceptance of applications, including high level statements of required information from applicant, such as demonstration of a sustainable ability to meet financial obligations and compliance obligations. The actual application process is in an Appendix to these Rules. The technical certification requirements can be listed in the Platform Operating Guideline.\n\n3.2 Licensing\nThis concept may or may not apply when the Scheme operator is a government entity. If the concept to licensing is not included in the rules, there needs to be a provision in \"Participation Eligibility\" section with respect to terminating a participant.\n\n\nA Participant is granted a License to participate in the Scheme and to use the Scheme Property in accordance with the Scheme Business Rules.\n\nA Participant may use Scheme Property only in accordance with the Scheme Business Rules. Licenses will limit use of Scheme Property to the Participant's provision of services in connection with the Scheme and according to the Rules.\n\nLicenses will not be exclusive.\n\n\n3.3 Tiered Access\nSchemes may choose to allow some applicants to access join the Scheme as indirect participants. This section specifies the conditions for this. Some Schemes separately enable technical indirect participation and settlement indirect participation.\n\nIf this is allowed, defined terms (such as Sponsor Bank and Indirect Participant) are required. This section should clearly show what the obligations of each party are; this can refer to the obligation sections appearing later.\n\n3.4 Departure from Participation\nProvisions for Scheme suspension or termination of a Participant's participation in the Scheme. The Scheme may suspend, limit or disqualify a Participant from participating in the Scheme if it determines that the Participant's inability to observe a Rule unduly burdens the Scheme or other Participants or poses undue risks to the integrity of the Scheme or the reputation of the Scheme\n\nProvisions for Participants to terminate their participation in the Scheme\n\n4. Scheme Business Rules\n4.1 Scope of the Scheme Business Rules\n\nThese Rules apply to each Participant and govern the rights and responsibilities of Participants and of the Scheme.\n\nThese Rules may be superseded to the extent that they conflict with any Applicable Laws. Nothing in these Rules shall be applied to require the Scheme or any Participant to violate Applicable Law.\n\nAll matters regarding interpretation of the Rules and all disputes arising in connection with participation in the Scheme will be subject to the laws of [xxxx]\n\n\nProvisions should be made for resolution of disputes among Participants or between Participants and the Scheme.\n\n4.2 Changes to the Scheme Business Rules\n\nParticipants may from time to time provide suggestions or requests for modification of the Rules.\n\nParticipant suggestions for modifications to the Rules may be used by the Scheme or by other Participants in connection with the Scheme without compensation or attribution to the Participant who makes the suggestion or request.\n\nChanges to the Rules will be made according to a consultative procedure:\n\nA Participant(s) or the Scheme may propose a change to the Scheme Business Rules.\n\nThe Scheme will publish proposals to all Participants and request comments and suggestions on these; all comments received will be published to all participants.\n\nThe Scheme may include with the publication of a proposed change its independently determined suggestion for the wording of a change in the Rules,\n\n\nScheme should have a defined process for adopting changes, which may include Participant voting or decision by the Scheme. If there is voting, rules here should specify the parameters.\n\n\nThe Scheme may grant variances to the Rules upon application from Participants.\n\nProvisions for urgent changes may be made by the Scheme to meet risks or regulatory requirements.\n\n\n5. Responsibilities and Obligations of the Scheme\n5.1 Defining and Providing Scheme Services\n\nThe Scheme defines the set of Scheme Services that are provided to Participants. The defined list of Scheme Services is shown in an Appendix to these Rules.\n\nScheme Services\n\n\nThe Scheme specifies how Scheme Services are provided to Participants - they may be operated by the Scheme entity, by another entity under contract to the Scheme, or there may be some other arrangement. This section gives the Scheme the right to define new services, change existing services, etc.\n\nThe Scheme may define service level standards for itself, and for participants in using these services\n\nFor outsourced Platform services, the Scheme specifies services to be provided. The Scheme may specify the service level agreements for providers of these services\n\nFor the Scheme Settlement Service, the Scheme selects and contracts with a Settlement Bank(s) for inter-Participant Settlement.\n\nThe Scheme establishes a Transaction Value Limit which sets the maximum value of any Transfer made through the Scheme Platform. DFSPs may set lower values for their customers.\n\nThe Scheme should consider if it will guaranty to the Payee DFSP any Fulfilled Transfer made in accordance with these Rules\n\n\nThe Scheme should consider if it will guaranty to the Payee DFSP any Fulfilled Transfer made in accordance with these Rules\n\n5.2 Writing, Updating, and Maintaining the Rules\n\nThe Scheme writes, updates, and maintains the Business Rules.\n\nThe Scheme is responsible for informing Participants of any changes to the Rules, all fees, policies that may impact Participants' use of the Scheme, or any other important and relevant information.\n\nThe Scheme is responsible for establishing a policy, and communicating this to Participants, for enforcement of the Rules;\n\nThe Scheme is responsible for establishing policies with respect to granting variances to the Rules to Participants,\n\n\n5.3 Other Scheme Responsibilities\n\nThe Scheme administers Participant on-boarding and exit processes. These processes are listed in an Appendix to these rules.\n\nThe Scheme monitors the ongoing eligibility of Participants under the requirements established for Participation\n\nThe Scheme defines a set of Use Cases and Secondary Use Cases. These are listed in an Appendix to these rules\n\nThe Scheme establishes the Fee Schedule and defines the processes by which Fees are collected. The Fee Schedule is in an Appendix to these rules\n\nThe Scheme sets the Scheme Brand and establishes guidelines for its use. These guidelines appear in an Associated Document.\n\nThe Scheme measures the progress of the Scheme and its Participants\n\nThe Scheme defines policies and procedures for Security, Risk Management, and Data Confidentiality for the Scheme and its Participants.\n\nThe Scheme defines policies and procedures for the management of Transaction Exceptions.\n\nThe Scheme engages in activities to promote and encourage the adoption and usage of the Scheme.\n\nThe Scheme plans for long-term enhancement and expansion of the Platform to meet evolving market needs and opportunities in the advancement of the Scheme's goals.\n\n\n6. Participant Responsibilities and Obligations of Participants\n\nParticipants are obliged to comply with these Business Rules and with the Associated Documents to these Rules.\n\nParticipants must comply with all Applicable Law with respect to their participation in the Scheme within the territories in which they operate and within which they use Scheme Services. The Scheme assumes no responsibility for Participants' compliance with Applicable Law.\n\nParticipants are required to permit use and disclosure of Personal Information as required by these Business Rules and to provide disclosures to their Customers and obtain consents where necessary regarding such use and disclosure of Personal Information as required by Applicable Law.\n\nParticipants agree to pay fees to the Scheme and to other Participants as specified in these rules.\n\nParticipants will adhere to Scheme brand specifications as specified in these rules.\n\nParticipants will use Scheme Services as specified in these rules.\n  Schemes will need to consider if they want to: 1) require the use of the scheme for scheme-eligible transactions (assuming the rules authority to do this); 2) require the use of the scheme platform for \"on-us\" transactions (would require separate, probably zero processing fee for such transactions); if \"on-us\" transactions don't go through the platform, if the scheme wants to require reporting of \"on-us\" transactions to the scheme, for use with a fraud utility.\n\nAll transfers made using the Scheme Brand or described as being made with the Scheme will be made using Scheme Services.\n  Schemes will need to consider if they want to state the above rule. Some Schemes may want Participants to use the Scheme brand for on-us transactions which do not use Scheme Services. This could be worded to say \"all interoperable transfers\"\n\n[Net Settlement Option] Participants will open a Settlement Bank Account with the scheme-specified Settlement Bank, or make available an existing account for these purposes, as allowed by the Scheme. [Continuous Gross Settlement Option] Participants will become a joint owner of the Scheme Pooled Settlement Account and sign Scheme Settlement Bank Account Agreement to that effect. Participants will transfer money into and out of that outcome from their existing reserve, clearing, or trust accounts at the Scheme Settlement Bank, as Scheme Operating Guidelines specify.\n\nParticipants will share information with the Scheme as strictly necessary for the operation of the Scheme, including for due diligence, technical onboarding, configuration, transactions management and other purposes as specified in the Rules.\n\nParticipants will be required by the Scheme to meet Security, Risk Management and Data Confidentiality standards specified by the Scheme.\n\nParticipants will provide adequate customer service to their customers in connection with the Scheme.\n\nParticipants must exclude customers from use of the Scheme upon request by the Scheme when the Scheme reasonably determines that a customer poses risk to the Scheme, which may include financial, legal, security, reputational risk or any other risk.\n\nParticipants will not, and will not permit customers, to use the Scheme for illegal purposes, including illegal goods or services; illegal payments, such as bribery, money laundering or financing of terrorism; poaching or trafficking in protected animal species or products.\n  Schemes can consider if they want to specify that Participants contractually prohibit customers from using Scheme Services for illegal purposes and will discontinue Scheme Services for customers who they know, or suspect are using Scheme Services to initiate or receive transfers for illegal purposes\n\n\n\n6.1 Responsibilities and Obligations of Participants as Payer DFSPs\n\nA Participant who originates a Quote Request or a Transfer Request is acting as a Payer Participant under these Rules.\n\nA Participant may initiate a Transaction on behalf of its Payer for any Use Case or Secondary Use Case supported by the Scheme.\n\nA Payer Participant is obligated to settle a Transfer upon submission of a Transfer Request, unless such Transfer Request is refused by the Payee DFSP or expires without fulfillment.\n\nThe Payer Participant warrants upon submission of each Transfer Request, that the Transfer is coming from an account that is KYC- and AML-compliant and is executed in accordance Applicable Law, and that the Payer has been provided all disclosure and has provided all consents necessary to conduct the Transfer in accordance with these Business Rules and under Applicable Law.\n\nThe Payer Participant warrants upon submission of a Request for Transfer, that the Transfer Request has been authorized by their Payer, and that their communications with their Payer have been properly authenticated in accordance with these Business Rules and Applicable Law.\n\nThe Payer Participant acknowledges that the Platform will reject a Transfer Request if the proposed Transfer would violate these Business Rules, such as exceeding the Payer Participant's Net Debit Cap.\n\n\n6.2 Responsibilities and Obligations of Participants as Payee DFSPs\n\nA Participant who receives and responds to a Quote Request or a\nTransfer Request is acting as a Payee Participant under these Rules.\n\nA Payee Participant who receives a Quote Request is required to respond, in the absence of technical issues, with a Quote Response if:\n\nThe Payee's Transaction Account with the Payee Participant is in good standing and capable of receiving, at that point in time, the Transfer Amount and\n\nAcceptance of the Transfer will not put the Payee account into a status not permitted by Applicable Law or the Participant's account policies and agreements.\n\nThe Payee Participant affirms, upon initiation of a Quote Response other than an error response, that the Payee account has been Validated -- it is open, in good standing, and able to accept the proposed Transfer Amount at that point in time.\n\n\n\nThe Payee Participant affirms, upon initiation of a Quote Response other than an error response, that a Transfer to the designated account complies at that point in time with applicable AML/CTF and KYC requirements.\n\nA Payee Participant who receives a Transfer Request is required, in the absence of technical issues, to respond with a Transfer Response with the Transaction State \"Committed\" if:\n\nThey have received a Quote Request and responded with a Quote Response for the Transaction and\n\nThe Quote Response has not yet expired\n\nThe Payee's Transaction Account with the Payee Participant is in good standing and capable of receiving, at that point in time, the Transfer Amount and\n\nAcceptance of the Transfer will not put the Payee account into a status not permitted by Applicable Law or the Participant's account policies and agreements and\n\nThe Transfer Request on the Transaction has not expired.\n\n\n\nA Payee Participant who sends a Transfer Response with a Transaction State \"Committed\" must post that Transfer to the Payee's account within [X time].\n\nA Payee Participant who receives a Transfer Request which does not meet the above criteria is required to respond with a Transfer Response with the Transaction State \"Aborted\".\n\nThe Payee Participant must affirm, upon submission of each Transfer Response with a Transaction State \"Committed\", that the Transfer is being credited to an account that is AML-compliant and is executed in accordance with any account volume limitations, or any other regulation that apply in the territories in which they operate, and that the Payee has been provided all disclosure and has provided all consents necessary to conduct the Transfer in accordance with the Rules and under Applicable Law.\n7.

Scheme Platform and Services\n\nThe Scheme defines the set of Scheme Services which Participants access to use the system. These are listed in an Appendix to this document. The core Scheme Services necessary for inter-operability are considered to be the Scheme Platform.\n\nTechnical and operational details on the use of Scheme Services, including the Scheme Platform, are provided in Associated Documents. This list of Associated Documents is an Appendix to this document.\n\n\n10. Exception Management\n\nProblems may occur during execution of a Transaction that result in exception cases, which may require or may be facilitated by inter-Participant communication. Exception cases may include errors on the part of any party, fraud, or other service anomalies.\n\nThe Scheme will create and maintain protocols by which Participants may determine the type of exception and suggested or required actions on the part of Participants to resolve the exception.

Secondary use cases are sub-sets of Use Cases and are used to demonstrate more finite differences in transfers. All transfers made via Scheme Services may be categorized by one, and only one, Use Case and Secondary Use Case.\n\nThe Use Case and Secondary Use Case of a Transaction may require different operational and technical details to apply, as specified in the Platform Operating Guideline; different interchange fees to apply, as specified in an Appendix to these rules; different requirements for exception management procedures to apply, as specified in an Associated Document to these rules\n\nAll Scheme Supported Use Cases and Secondary Use Case are defined by attributes of the transactions, which are specified in the Platform Operating Guide.\n\nThe following is an example of a table of Use Cases and Secondary Use Cases that a scheme might support.\n\nA scheme would only define Secondary Use Cases if it wanted to write rules and/or specify fees that are unique to that Secondary Use Case\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Case\nSecondary Use Case\n\n\n\n\n1.0\nP2P\nPerson to Person\n\n\n1.1\nP2P\nWallet to wallet\n\n\n1.2\nP2P\nBank to bank\n\n\n1.3\nP2P\nWallet to bank\n\n\n1.4\nP2P\nBank to Wallet\n\n\n2.0\nBulk Payment\n\n\n\n2.1\nB2P\nBusiness to Person\n\n\n2.2\nG2P\nGovernment to Person\n\n\n3.0\nP2B\nPerson to Business\n\n\n3.1\nP2B\nTill Number Purchase\n\n\n3.2\nP2B\nQR code Purchase\n\n\n3.3\nP2B\nOnline Purchase\n\n\n3.4\nP2B\nBill Payment\n\n\n3.5\nP2B\nPerson to Business - Other\n\n\n4.0\nP2G\n\n\n\n4.1\nP2G\nPerson to Government\n\n\n4.1\nP2G\nTill Number Purchase\n\n\n4.2\nP2G\nQR code Purchase\n\n\n4.3\nP2G\nOnline Purchase\n\n\n4.4\nP2G\nBill Payment\n\n\n\n15.

The project is intended to support entities (countries, regions, associations of providers or commercial enterprises) implementing new payments systems using Mojaloop code. These entities will also need write Business Rules that participants in the system will follow.\nThe Mojaloop Community Business Document Project provides templates for Business Rules and related documents. There are many choices involved in implementing a new payment system: the templates show some of the choices and, where appropriate, commentary is provided on how the particular choice is related to the goals of a Level One aligned system.\nThe following documents are part of the project:\n\nScheme Key Choices\n\nScheme Participation Agreement Template\n\nScheme Business Rules Template\n\nPlatform Operating Guideline Template\n\nException Management Operating Guideline Template\n\nUniform Glossary\n\n\nIntroduction\nPayments Schemes around the world are in the process of implementing, or considering implementation, of Mojaloop-based payments systems. Mojaloop is open-source software for financial services companies, government regulators, and others taking on the challenges of interoperability and financial inclusion. Mojaloop is based on the specification \"Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification\", which was developed to provide an open API specification for mobile money interoperability.\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has provided funding and support for Mojaloop. Mojaloop is open source reference code which demonstrates the principles of the Level One Project, a vision for digital financial markets based on principles of interoperability, collaboration, and inclusion.\nSchemes implementing Mojaloop will need to make a number of business choices about the design of the system. These choices, when made, will affect both the technical implementation of Mojaloop and the Business Rules which the Scheme will write, and which Participant DFSPs will agree to follow. This document describes and discusses some of the most significant of these choices. Where appropriate, recommendations for best practices are made to align with the Level One Project (L1P) Design Principles.\nAlthough this document is written as a contribution to the Mojaloop community, the issues described here are pertinent to any Level One aligned payments system, regardless of the technical implementation chosen.\nChoices Described in this Document\n1 - Choice: Ownership of Scheme\n2 - Choice: Participation in the Scheme\n3 - Choice: Relationship of Scheme to Platform\n4 - Choice: Scope of Scheme Rules and Scheme Rules Authority\n5 - Choice: Use Cases\n6 - Choice: QR Codes\n7 - Choice: Payments Addressing\n8 - Choice: Interparticipant Settlement\n9 - Choice: Tiered Access\n10 - Choice: Scheme Fees and End User Pricing\n11 - Choice: Brand Management\n12 - Choice: Scheme Connections to Other Schemes\n13 - Choice: Scheme Use by Other FSP's\n14 - Choice: Scheme Risk Management Standards\n15 - Choice: Exception Management\n1. Choice: Ownership of Scheme\nThe Scheme is the entity that writes the rules for the payment system. As such, the scheme controls multiple aspects of the delivery of scheme services, including how the technical and operational platform will be delivered to participating DFSPs. Common models in for Scheme ownership in the payments industry include:\n\nAn association of participating DFSPs, with or without partial ownership by the Central bank\n\nA Central Bank or other government entity\n\nA commercial entity\n\n\nThe association model maximizes DFSP control of the Scheme and may encourage DFSPs to join and use the scheme. A government or central-bank controlled scheme may make regulatory supervision of DFSPs more effective and may make decision-making simpler: a government body may be willing to make infrastructure decisions that are for the good for the ecosystem as a whole, rather than optimizing individual DFSP benefits. A commercial entity may be faster to implement a new system and may be more effective in some situations in creating a sustainable operating model.\n1.1 Level One Alignment -- Scheme Ownership\nAny of these ownership structures can deliver on the goals of L1P and financial inclusion. The Level One Design Principles suggest \"self-governance by DFSPs\" (the first model) as a preferred design, based on a belief that participation in governance can increase DFSP commitment to the scheme. Other designs can work, however, as long as the Scheme and its members have some form of participatory governance and operate with transparency and open communications.\nThe most important Level One principle is that the Scheme itself should operate on a \"not for loss\" (sustainable cost recovery) model. The latter is particularly important in order to deliver on the L1P goal of creating an ultra-low-cost payment system. This principle is predicated on the idea that DFSPs may, of course, operate on a for-profit basis in delivering payment services. The source of their revenues, however, may be primarily from \\\"adjacencies\\\" rather than fees related to the payment transaction itself. Note that the operating platform may be provided by a commercial entity, even if the Scheme itself is operated on a \"not for loss\" basis. This is discussed further below in \"Choice: Relationship of Scheme to Platform\".\nMany legacy bank payments systems worldwide operate on the association model. ACH systems and domestic debit card systems (such as the U.S. ACH and Canada's Interac system) use this model and deliver ultra-low processing costs to participating DFSPs. Some new mobile payments systems, such as India's UPI system and Peru's BIM system also use this model.\nSeveral countries provide services through the Central Bank: Mexico's SPEI model is notable here. Jordan's JoMoPay system started as a Central Bank system and has moved to the association model.\nThe global card networks, notably Visa and MasterCard, started as association models and have moved to a commercial model. Many FinTechs, such as PayPal or WeChat Payments, operate closed-loop systems on a commercial model.\n2. Choice: Participation in the Scheme\nMojaloop and L1P use the term \"DFSP\" (Digital Financial Services Provider) to mean any entity within the jurisdiction in which the payment system operates that is licensed in some manner to provide end-user transaction accounts which hold funds, and which can be used to make and receive payments. This definition includes bank, other depository financial institutions, and eMoney issuers (sometimes referred to as Mobile Money Operators).\nThere are myriad other ecosystem participants who do not hold end-user transaction accounts: these include processors, aggregators, and some types of payments services providers. The relationship of these entities to the scheme and to DFSPs is discussed in \"Choice: Scheme Use by Other FSP's\".\nThe question of participation is twofold: first, which categories of DFSPs are supported by the Scheme, and secondly, what is the process by which DFSPs are allowed to participate. The term \"open loop\" is used to refer to a structure in which multiple DFSPs join and use the scheme to exchange transactions (interoperate). But an \"open loop\" scheme can either be one in which any DFSP in a supported category is eligible to join the scheme, or one in which participation is limited, and managed by invitation. An applicant DFSP may face certain eligibility criteria (size, financial health, etc.) before being admitted to the Scheme.\nThe term \"closed loop\" is most often used to refer to a scheme which is not interoperable; in which the scheme entity has direct relationships with all end customers\nL1P is strongly in favor of open loop systems. Furthermore, L1P advocates for all licensed providers of transaction accounts to be eligible: in other words, both bank and eMoney Issuer categories should be included, and allowed to interoperate through the Scheme platform.\nThere are a number of arguments which support this recommendation. The very concept of \"financial inclusion\" implies including previously excluded populations into the financial ecosystem of the country. In many countries, eMoney issuance or other structures have been approved by regulators to provide transaction accounts to populations that have not been able to be served economically by traditional banks. These eMoney issuers have frequently created closed-loop mobile wallets, and one of the goals of L1P and Mojaloop is to enable interoperability of these wallets. However, wallet holders need to pay not just other wallet holders, but merchants and other banked institutions, and banked individuals. Banked individuals and institutions also make payments to wallet holders. It makes sense that the same interoperable payment system should support both for efficiency reasons (why have multiple systems when a single system can connect all players?) and for economic reasons.\nThe economic argument revolves around the nature of transactional processing systems: the more volume, the lower the unit cost. This principle is also supported in the World Bank/CPMI PAFI Report: \\\"the framework promotes innovation and competition by not hindering the entry of new types of PSP.... Increased interoperability of and access to infrastructures supporting the switching, processing, clearing and settlement of payment instruments of the same kind are promoted... payment infrastructures, including those operated by central banks, have objective, risk-based participation requirements that permit fair and open access to their services.\\\" A related and important point is that Scheme rules should specify that an individual Participant cannot discriminate against any other individual Participant: unless constrained by other factors (regulatory account limits, etc.), Participants must receive transactions sent by other Participants in the Scheme. This ensures full interoperability.\nThe second question is what eligibility criteria a potential DFSP must meet in order to actually join the scheme. Many payments schemes have fairly elaborate procedures to ensure that applicant DFSPs have the financial resources to comply with rules, and the technical wherewithal to meet the operational requirements of the rules.\nSome form of these requirements is necessary for any scheme. But modern technology and, in particular, pre-funded settlement models greatly reduce the risks to the scheme in dealing with smaller DFSPs. The Level One alignment issue here is to ensure that the scheme is not inadvertently discriminating against smaller DFSPs and in favor of large ones. The goal should be to ensure the minimum necessary qualifications to support the obligations that a DFSP applicant is undertaking.\n3. Choice: Relationship of Scheme to Platform\nOur definitions separate the concept of a scheme (the entity that rights the rules for a payment system) and a platform (the set of services that physically enable interoperability). Most often, but not necessarily, the platform operates as a switch which routes transactions from one DFSP to another: the alternative is bilateral physical connections among DFSPs.\nWhat is the relationship between the scheme and the platform? There are multiple models demonstrated in payments systems globally:\n\nSame entity: the scheme operates the platform. This is seen frequently in commercial systems (e.g. Visa) and also in Central Bank provided systems (e.g. Bank of Mexico SPEI)\n\nThe scheme hires the platform: the switch and related services are operated by a separate entity, under contract to the scheme entity. The scheme pays the platform entity; this cost is recouped in fees from the scheme to its participating DFSPs. The U.K. Faster Payments system operates on this model (Faster Payments Scheme Ltd. hires Vocalink to operate the platform).\n\nThe scheme sets for the parameters by which operator(s) manage transactions governed by the rules: if there are multiple operators, those entities must interoperate, again as specified in Scheme rules. Individual DFSPs choose the operator they wish to use to access the system. The U.S. ACH system works in this manner, as do several of the SEPA payments systems in Europe.\n\nNo switch: this is really a variation of the model 3 above. Each DFSP independently and physically connects to each other DFSP, again within constraints set by the scheme rules. Debit cards in Australia work this way.\n\n\n3.1 L1P Alignment: Relationship of Scheme to Platform\nThere is no single Level One Principle that argues in favor of one of these models vs. the other. Factors for consideration include:\n\nThe goal is that all of the ecosystem players (Scheme, Platform, DFSPs, etc.) encourage L1P-compliant behavior. A more controlled model (models 1 or 2) arguably makes this easier.\n\nHaving a low-cost system is a core tenet. However, it is debatable whether this is better achieved through Model 1 or Model 2. Models 3 and 4 bear the risk of excluding or disadvantaging smaller DFSPs or new system entrants.\n\nIn Models 2 and 3, the platform providers will have their own operating guidelines. There may be situations in which provisions of Scheme rules are not adequately reflected or implemented by the Platform. This is an issue of power and control. Model 1 avoids this problem but could create a \\\"vendor lock-in\\\" type of problem, where DFSPs have no choice but to pay the costs of the Scheme-controlled platform.\n\n\n4. Choice: Scope of Scheme Rules and Scheme Rules Authority\n4.1 Scope\nScheme rules vary widely in scope from scheme to scheme. All cover the essential elements of scheme participation, party obligations, and the mechanics of interoperability. But many schemes go much further in terms of defining how DFSPs make payments services available to their customers, and under which terms. Two areas here are worthy of note: - Some schemes specify elements of the end-user experience. Examples of this include the card networks specifying card physical parameters and design requirements. Some systems (for example, Peru\\'s BIM) specify how the mobile phone interface appears to a consumer. Other systems (for example, India\\'s UPI) go so far as to provide the SKD\\'s and API\\'s that define what the end-user app can functionally do. Some systems may require that a DFSP receiving a credit-push transaction must post it to a customer\\'s account within a specified amount of time - Some schemes also specify elaborate liability provisions on interoperable transactions. These provisions may vary according to use case and particular attributes of a transaction. For example, in the card networks, liability may pass from the card issuer to the merchant acquirer if the merchant terminal does not meet certain specifications.\n4.2 Rules Authority\nAs described above, the scheme is the entity that writes the rules for the payment system. But who approves these rules? There are two primary models in the market place:\n\nDFSP Authority. In this model, all (or some) rules changes are voted on by participating DFSPs. The voting may be determined on a per-seat basis, or it may be determined on a volume-weighted basis. Many schemes have experimented with variations on this.\n\nScheme Authority with DFSP Participation. In this model, rules authority rests with the scheme entity, but some degree of formal or informal participation by DFSPs is included: this can either be formal (standing committees that meet to consider rule changes, rules amendment commentary periods specified in the rules, etc.) or informal (scheme representatives meet and/or request written feedback on proposed rules changes).\n\n\n4.3 L1P Alignment -- Rules Scope and Authority\nThere are two relevant Level One principles: one is for participatory governance, and the other is the mandate to deliver a low-cost system. Level One also recognizes the importance of a system that is convenient and easy for end-user customers to use, particularly poor consumers and merchants. Considerations therefore include:\n\nRules can create costs: the more elaborate the rules are specifying how DFSPs must deliver services to the customer, the higher the costs of complying with these rules will be.\n\nOffsetting this is the value of having a common consumer experience - there is considerable evidence that having a common experience can help consumers self-educate in the use of services. Arguably, this is an important factor in scaling the system. But the further a scheme goes in writing rules that effect end-user experience, the more important it is that participating DFSPs have some voice in these rules.\n\nScheme experience has shown that explicit voting rules, although they sound good to DFSPs, often result in very long decision practices: this is one reason why some schemes use the second above, and use participating DFSPs as sounding boards, but do not grant rules authority.\n\n\n5. Choice: Use Cases\nOne of the most important choices a scheme has to make is which use cases to support. Frequently, a real-time credit-push retail scheme starts with person to person (P2P) payments as the first use case: often, a scheme will indicate to the market that it intends to support other use cases in the future. As schemes evolve there are significant \"sub use cases\" to consider: in some Mojaloop implementations, the term \"secondary use case\" is used for this: as an example, if P2P is the use case, cross-border P2P might be a secondary use case; wallet-to-wallet and wallet-to-bank account might be secondary use cases.\nBusiness rules may vary by use case and/or secondary use case. This may include operational details (data fields used, etc.), scheme pricing (in particular, interchange) and even liability provisions.\nThe Open API document used by the Mojaloop code includes the following list of use cases:\n\nP2P Transfer\nAgent-Initiated Cash In\nAgent-Initiated Cash Out\nAgent-Initiated Cash Out Authorized on POS\nCustomer-Initiated Cash Out\nMerchant-Initiated Merchant Payment\nMerchant-Initiated Merchant Payment Authorized on POS\nATM-Initiated Cash Out\nRefund\n\nAn implementing scheme will choose its own primary and secondary use cases, and the definitions of these will be in the Business Rules. Schemes should consider the following:\n\nEventual scheme-to-scheme interoperability will be easier (especially from one Mojaloop-implemented scheme to another) if the same primary use cases and definitions are used\n\nSchemes may need to differentiate between a DFSP's ability to initiate transactions in a specific use case or secondary use case, and requirements that a DFSP needs to be able to support receiving transactions in a specific use case or secondary use case\n\nAny rules that are written specific to a use case or secondary use case need to be systemically detectable (by labelling or inference) if the rule will be automatically applied: this is particularly important for business-case-specific interchange fees. How this is done should be part of the business documentation, in the Operating Guidelines.\n\n\n5.1 L1P Alignment -- Use Cases\nThere are two considerations here. One significant issue is the relationship between high volumes in a payment system and the ability to deliver ultra-low-cost processing fees to participating DFSPs. Almost all retail payments systems support multiple use cases, including those which started with a single use case. The card networks are an excellent example of this: started to support point of sale purchases, they now support online purchases, bill payment, salary payments, and B2B payments. Payment processing is a scale business: the more volume, the lower the unit costs can be. Level One strongly supports a payment system being used for multiple use cases: ideally, all retail (e.g. excluding large value B2B) use cases in a country.\nThe other consideration is making the payment system easy for end-users to access and understand. The same system, with similar user interfaces, etc. for use cases will be easier for end-users (particularly poor or uneducated users) to use.\n6 Choice: QR Codes\nQR codes are emerging as a major enabler of merchant payments in developing countries. Both payment schemes and national payment authorities are deciding on formats, protocols, and scope for QR codes. Some of the decisions include:\n\nIs the QR code presented by the merchant, and scanned by the consumer, or presented by the consumer and scanned by the merchant? Level One has a preference for merchant-presented QR codes, implemented in conjunction with push, not pull payments. A merchant-presented QR code can be combined with a till number to enable consumers with feature phones to easily pay the same merchant.\n\nIs the QR code static (the same for all purchases), or is it dynamic? Rather than a choice, this is being seen as an evolution: most markets are starting with static QR codes, but have plans to move to dynamic codes. Dynamic codes function like a \"request to pay\" payment message in a push payment system, and can contain purchase-specific data.\n\nDoes the national approach to QR codes use a \"shared QR code\" approach, in which a single QR code can represent a merchant's payments credentials across multiple schemes? The most common way in which this approach is implemented is through the use of EMVCo QR code standards. An alternative is a single QR code approach, in which a QR code is used only to access either an interoperable payment scheme (for example, Mexico's CoDi system) or a closed-loop system (for example, China's WeChat Payments). A single QR code approach may create low-cost advantages by driving volume through a single national platform, while a cross-scheme approach may enable competition among multiple schemes.\n\nIf a shared QR code approach is used, is there a single national entity that controls which schemes a given merchant accepts? If so, who runs this \"repository\" function and what are its functions? Does it actually issue the QR code data string? If yes, does it sign the string and validate it? There is some speculation that a QR code repository could serve as a point of cross-payments system oversight and management of fraud. It could also tie into a national business registration scheme in some way. It is interesting to consider that a cross-scheme QR code repository might require its own business rules, which would become \"meta rules\" which would exist above the business rules of the individual schemes.\n\nDoes the QR code data string (the \"payload\") contain the merchant's \"payment address\", or does it point in some way to a place where this is stored? The latter approach provides more flexibility and supports a merchant's ability to change providers.\n\nHow is the consumer (and the merchant) protected from QR code fraud?\n\nWhat are the economics of the transaction to the merchant? Level One has a strong preference for zero, or near-zero pricing to the small or poor merchant.\n\n\n7. Choice: Payments Addressing\nAny scheme implementing credit-push payments needs to specify how the payer and their Payer DFSP addresses the payment. The address needs in some way to be resolved into the payee's account number at the DFSP who provides their transaction account. The scheme needs to decide:\n\nWhat types of payments addresses (sometimes called \"identifiers\") are used. Some payments addresses are institutional ID's and account numbers: a bank routing number and bank account number are an example of this. Other payments addresses may be account numbers without the institutional ID: a mobile phone number used to direct funds to an eMoney wallet provided by an MNO is an example of this. All other types of payments addresses are aliases of some sort. An alias may be an email address, a scheme-assigned merchant ID, a national identity number, or a mobile phone number used to direct funds to account other than that provided by an MNO eMoney issuer. An scheme-supported alias may also be a phrase: \"payadamnu123\".\n\nFor each type of payment address supported by the scheme, the scheme needs to determine how that payment address is resolved. At a minimum, the scheme needs to support a mechanism by which the address is mapped to a DFSP scheme participant responsible for the transaction account associated with that payment address. Resolution can be done in a number of different ways:\n\nThe scheme can maintain a directory mapping addressing to responsible DFSP ID's: this requires some type of DFSP registration process for addresses.\n\nThe scheme can maintain a directory which maps the address to the responsible DFSP and also specifies the account number: this requires a slightly different registration process.\n\nEither of these types of directories can be maintained by a third party: scheme rules would establish how these directories are populated, maintained and used, and what the responsibilities of the various parties are.\n\nA scheme may also use a broadcast method to determine the DFSP responsible for a given payment address (\"do you claim this address\"), but needs to develop a protocol to manage conflicts if more than one DFSP \"claims\" the address.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the resolution method can different for each type of supported payment address. Some supported payment address types may also be accompanied by particular data sets: for\nexample, when a payment is being made in payment of an invoice, the payment address may be some type of alias, and that use of that alias may be tied to accompanying invoice data. Dynamic QR codes, as an example, will create a \"request to pay\" that may contain the scheme-supported merchant ID (an alias) and accompanying transaction data detail.\n\n\nThe Open API specification and the Mojaloop reference code support a wide range of different address types: mobile number, bank account, national ID, aliases (\"Quickshop\\@abc\"), etc.\n7.1 L1P Alignment -- Payments Addressing\nSecure, easy payment addressing relates to two important concepts in Level One: convenience for the end-user and \"openness\". The latter is particularly important to enable competition and rapid scaling of a\npayment system. As schemes (Level One and otherwise) worldwide struggle to determine how to best solve the question of payments addressing, a few best practices appear to be emerging:\n\nAlthough the use of the mobile number, in particular, as an address has an obvious appeal, there appears to be a trend to use aliases -- identifiers with no additional meaning. This is demonstrated in India with the UPI system and in Australia's new real-time system, where the identifier is referred to as the PAYID.\n\nIdentifier portability is desirable, both from the perspective of user convenience and as a mechanism to avoid \"DFSP lock-in\".\n\nAs mentioned above, the directory needs to ensure uniqueness of the payment address within the payment system: any given address can only map to a single DFSP. However, a single DFSP transaction account can have multiple payment addresses which route to it. DFSPs have the opportunity to create value-added services for their customers, in which they differentiate the treatment of transactions routed to them via different payment addresses (subject, of course, to overall scheme business rules.)\n\n\n8. Choice: Interparticipant Settlement\nPayment schemes need to determine how participant DFSPs will settle their financial obligations to each other arising from interoperable transactions. There are multiple decisions to be made on the settlement model. Existing settlement models used in legacy retail payment systems have important controls over risks. As a general statement, schemes to today have opportunities to make choices leveraging modern technology and connectivity to manage these risks in different ways. Some of the choices are:\n\nNet, gross, or continuous gross settlement. Traditionally, net settlement has been used for retail payments systems (practically speaking, all systems except RTGS). Some real-time retail payment systems are now using gross settlement (Mexico's SPEI) or are planning to (Brazil). Some systems are using a continuous gross settlement account (U.S. RTP): in this approach, DFSPs jointly own a single account at the Settlement Bank, and ownership shares in the pooled account are determined, at any point in time, by the DFSPs ledger position at the platform. This approach uses no settlement entries, netting, or settlement entry posting.\n\nChoice of settlement bank. Most interoperable retail payment systems use the country's central bank as the settlement bank, but there are examples (card network settlement in the U.S.) where a commercial bank is used as the settlement bank.\n\nDedicated or multi-purpose settlement accounts. Are the DFSP's settlement accounts, held at the settlement bank, dedicated to the purpose of scheme settlement, or are they used for other purposes (other scheme settlements, reserve balances, etc.) as well? In a continuous gross settlement model, the pooled account is always a dedicated account.\n\nSame day or deferred settlement. In a net settlement model, are settlement entries posted to settlement bank accounts on the day of the transaction, or later?\n\nMultiple or single settlement windows. In a net settlement model, is there a single settlement window per business day, or are there multiple? If multiple, are the windows defined by time periods, volume of transactions, or some other factor?\n\nPrefunded or not. Are settlement entries (in a net system) or individual transactions (in a gross system) allowed to occur if there is not sufficient funding in the settlement bank account? If so, what mechanisms (lines of credit, collateral accounts, etc.) are used to support this risk? The term \"prefunded\" is used when scheme rules specify that the DFSP must have enough money in their settlement account to cover an outbound transaction: if not, the platform will refuse the transaction.\n\nDynamic position management or not. In a net settlement system which uses a switch, does the switch \"know\" the actual position of the sending DFSP before sending the transaction on to the receiving DFSP?\n\nAutomated or manual net debit cap calculation. The net debit cap is an amount that the system uses, in conjunction with dynamic position management, to determine whether or not an individual transaction is sent to the receiving DFSP. This can either be manually set by the scheme (individually for each DFSP) or automated: the latter requires a real-time connection between the (dedicated) settlement bank account and the switch.\n\nDiscretionary components of the net debit camp may be defined by the scheme. There are two types of these. A scheme discretionary component may add to, or subtract from, an individual DFSP's net debit cap. An addition can be used to create a safety margin; a subtraction can be used to extend overdraft capabilities to the DFSP. In the latter case, responsibility for the overdraft needs to be clearly agreed upon between the scheme and the settlement bank.\n\n\n8.1 L1P Alignment -- Interparticipant Settlement\nLevel One has a clear principle calling for same day settlement. Other than that, the most important considerations are how a given scheme will manage risk and costs for DFPS -- liquidity costs in particular. This is a rapidly evolving area in payment systems, and it is expected that different schemes will make different choices. In general, it can be observed that automation supports scale, and that prefunding and multiple windows support low risk and low cost.\nThe Mojaloop reference code supports a variety of different settlement mechanisms.\n9. Choice: Tiered Access\nLegacy retail payment systems (and wholesale systems) generally support tiered access -- the ability of smaller institutions to access the system through correspondent relationships with larger institutions. This has been considered necessary as smaller institutions frequently had difficulty in meeting either the settlement obligations of full participation or the technical (particularly security) obligations of full participation.\nIn countries with eMoney Issuance licenses (or with other non-bank or non-traditional DFSPs, or transaction account providers) the question becomes whether or not these non-traditional providers access the system directly or through a relationship with a traditional bank: in these cases, it is generally the settlement, and not the technical, issue in question.\n9.1 L1P Alignment -- Tiered Access\nThere is no single Level One principle which would direct a scheme on how to handle this issue. There are, however, both cost and risk issues to consider:\n\nIt should be noted that larger institutions have created very profitable businesses in serving these smaller institutions. These costs, born by the indirect participants, will in some way be passed on to end-users. Because of this, Level One schemes may want to avoid this model where possible.\n\nThe Level One principle of \"Open Loop\" suggests that a scheme should support the ability of all DFSPs to participate directly wherever possible: modern technology, such as that used by Mojaloop, and prefunded settlement models should make this simpler.\n\nLegacy systems also tend to \"hide\" the activity of the smaller institution from the scheme or the hub. This may be undesirable from a regulatory or risk management point of view. Some new retail real-time payment systems (notably the U.S. RTP Network) are allowing both technical and settlement indirect access with full transparency of the smaller institution to the scheme and platform.\n\nAnother factor to consider is particular to countries with eMoney Issuance or other non-traditional DFSP providers. Under the L1P principle of DFSP involvement in governance decisions, it may be that asking eMoney Issuers to access a system \"under\" a bank participant may leave these DFSPs in a \"second tier\" position with respect to governance: this is arguably undesirable, and particularly in cases, which appear relevant in some countries, where the eMoney Issuers have a higher transaction volume than do their sponsoring banks.\n\n\nNote this section does not discuss access to the system by other FSPs: that is addressed in Choice: Scheme Use by Other FSPs.\n10. Choice: Scheme Fees and End User Pricing\nFees associated with an interoperable payment scheme can be categorized as:\n\nEnd-User Fees: the fees (or minimum balance requirements, etc.) assessed by a DFSP to their end-user customer. This includes fees charged to consumers, merchants, billers, governments or other enterprises. Some of these fees are specifically attached to the interoperable transfer itself (e.g. a \"send transfer\" fee, or a \"merchant discount fee\"); others are related (a \"cash-out\" fee, an ATM withdrawal fee). These fees are typically set by the DFSP. In some countries and situations, regulation or scheme rule agreements may apply to or influence the fees. Fees may either be fixed amounts; fixed amounts; percent-of-value amounts, or a combination of fixed and percent of value. In either case, fee schedules can differ based on which value-bands (for example, transactions lower than value \"X\" have this fee) or end-user transaction volume.\n\nProcessing Fees: the fee that the Scheme, and the Operator of the Platform (if different) charge to the DFSPs for use of the scheme and platform. As with end-user fees, processing fees can be fixed or variable and may also vary by value-band or transaction volume.\n\nInterchange Fees: fees that one DFSP pays to another DFSP related to an interoperable transaction. Interchange Fees are normally set by the Scheme (in the Scheme Rules) and are physically tabulated and collected by the Scheme. The scheme and the operator of the Platform do not pay or receive these fees: they are a debit to one DFSP and a credit to the other. Both the rate of interchange fees and direction (does the Payer DFSP pay or receive?) may vary by use case and secondary use case. Interchange fees may be fixed, a percent of value, or a combination of the two.\n\n\nIn addition to setting fee policies, schemes will need to decide on how fees are collected and (in the case of interchange fees) disbursed. There is an important consideration with interchange: should the fees be collected and disbursed as a part of the settlement of each transaction, or as an end-of-period (such as monthly) billing process?\n10.1 L1P Alignment: Fees\nOne of the most important Level One concepts is to have an ultra-low-cost platform, with consumer and small merchant fees being as low as possible. An important element in achieving this for a payment system is reaching scale. Schemes will want to consider both of these factors as they set fee policies. Considerations include:\n\nEnd-user pricing. Is the scheme in a position to put any controls or limitations on this? The answer will vary by jurisdiction. Some schemes have put limitations on the structure of fees (e.g. must be flat vs. percent of value), which parties can be charged (e.g. payers can be charged but not payees, etc.) or on what overall fees can be. Some schemes have not written this into rules but have encouraged informal agreement on fee policies (subject to regulatory approvals) to incent consumer usage. Other schemes have prohibited certain types of fee actions, such as charging surcharges for interoperable transactions.\n\nProcessing Fees. The goal here is for the scheme fees to DFSPs to be as low as possible (specifically and ideally, a fraction of a U.S. cent.). Best market practices are for these fees to be fixed, rather than percent-of-value: this makes sense given that the scheme and the platform are not taking value risk in processing the transactions. However, there is a challenge with purely fixed fees: how to avoid having fees that are too high for very low-value transactions. Some schemes are addressing this through value bands, with lower fixed charges for transactions under a certain value. Some schemes are establishing volume tiers to incent DFSPs. Schemes may wish to encourage (or even mandate) that DFSPs route \"on-us\" transactions (where payer and payee DFSP are the same institution) through the platform: if this is the case, the scheme may wish to set a zero fee for these transactions. Some schemes may also charge membership fees and/or onboarding fees to DFSPs. Finally, some schemes may provide a period of time after launch of the scheme in which all fees are waived.\n\nInterchange Fees. This is a complex and often debated topic in the payment industry worldwide, and one which frequently attracts regulatory scrutiny. Schemes may want to consider:\n\nWhether or not to have interchange at all. Some payments systems have this; many do not. Retail real-time payments systems worldwide are split on whether or not they support the use of interchange, and where they do, in which direction interchange flows for use cases such as P2P.\n\nInterchange is a useful mechanism for a form of billing: where the receiver of a valuable service (such as a merchant who wants access to a consumer's payment account) has no relationship with the provider of that service (the consumer's DFSP). Another example of this is where one bank's ATM is used to disburse funds to another bank's customer.\n\nInterchange is more questionable when it is being used to support legacy business models: for example, if an interoperable transaction causes a paying DFSP to \"lose\" a cash-out fee they would otherwise have gained, the scheme may specify an interchange rate in which the Payee DFSP pays the Payer DFSP to compensate for this loss. It may be practical to use interchange in these situations in the short run, but in the long run one can argue that the underlying business model needs to evolve.\n\nSchemes should keep in mind that wherever interchange is used, a \"hard cost\" is being created that is being absorbed by, and probably passed on in end-user fees, by the interchange-paying-DFSP.\n\n\n\n\n11. Choice: Brand Management\nShould a scheme brand be used? Should the same brand be used for all use cases? Or should the only brand used be the brand of the DFSP who is offering a service to its customers? Not surprisingly, this is an issue that has been debated in payments systems through the years.\n11.1 L1P Alignment -- Brand\nLevel One has a clear design principle supporting a common brand: this is predicated on making the service understandable and easy to use for both consumers and merchants. A common scheme brand may be used in conjunction with DFSP brands: \"Use DFSP SuperPay (DFSP brand) with XPay (Scheme brand) to pay your bills.\"\nBusiness rules will need to specify how and where the common brand is used.\n12. Choice: Scheme Connections to Other Schemes\nThe advent of roughly similar real-time retail payments systems worldwide has led to many discussions about the desirability of connecting these schemes to each other. This can both facilitate transactions within a country, but notably has importance for cross-border payments of all kinds, including workers\\' remittances.\nIn legacy payment systems, this type of connection is rare on a scheme-to-scheme basis. Notable exceptions to this are the connection domestically of ATM networks, and the connection of domestic card schemes that are owned or controlled by global card networks. What happens, instead, is that DFSPs or other providers who have participation in multiple networks (either directly or through partnerships) create the effect of cross-scheme connection through individual deals: this is, essentially, how cross-border correspondent banking works.\nMojaloop as a technology is designed to allow system-to-system connectivity. Schemes implementing Mojaloop systems will need to consider the balance between striking scheme-to-scheme business agreements (with concurrent technical connections) and/or allowing DFSPs in their scheme to connect to other schemes or DFSPs bilaterally.\n12.1 L1P Alignment -- Connections to Other Schemes\nThe relevant L1P principles here are low cost and \"openness\". The Mojaloop code in particular has the potential to turn cross-border transactions from ones that are governed by complex relationships (as in the case of traditional correspondent banking) into ones which are competed for in an open, interconnected marketplace. Schemes will need to evaluate the merits of this (arguably promoting lower costs) with the risks of dominance by major institutions. Scheme-to-scheme business arrangements may have a beneficial \"level the playing field\" characteristics. Hybrid relationships are also possible. This is an evolving area of the payment industry, and one where considerable variety of arrangements are both possible and likely.\n13 Choice: Scheme Use by Other FSP's\nA successful L1P aligned scheme will be used by many enterprises -- merchants, billers, government agencies, etc. as well as individual people. There will also be a wide range of other FSPs (Financial Services providers) which are not DFSP's: in other words, which do not hold customer transaction accounts. This includes payments services providers: aggregators, merchant services providers, various DFSP processors, etc., all of which may want to connect to and use the scheme.\nAs described in the \"participation\" choice above, a Level One aligned scheme includes as direct, settling participants only the entities that hold the end-user transaction accounts: the accounts that are debited and credited as a result of the interoperable transaction.\nOther entities may physically connect to the platform under a variety of business arrangements. The scheme will need to decide how involved scheme business rules are in dictating terms or standards for these arrangements. As a general principle, any other FSP connecting to the platform will need to be acting on behalf of a DFSP whose customer's transaction account is being debited (the payer DFSP) or credited (the payee DFSP). In legacy payments models, the DFSP retains all of the financial obligations and liabilities for the transaction: the third party is acting purely on behalf of the DFSP. Scheme business rules may specify requirements for the business arrangements between the DFSP and the third party. In some jurisdictions (notably India and the EU) regulation is driving changes to this model to allow other FSPs to have more direct involvement in schemes. Scheme rules will need to carefully describe and proscribe the parameters of these arrangements.\nDefinitional note: we are purposefully not using the term \"PSP\" (Payment Service Provider) here, as in various jurisdictions this term is used to include transaction account providers, in some cases, and non-transaction account providers in other cases. As a further comment, in many countries today entities such as aggregators hold financial accounts at banks or eMoney Issuers and use those accounts to receive money from customers and disburse money to other customers. In this role, the aggregator is a customer of a DFSP (the bank or eMoney Issuer) and is also acting as a Financial Services Provider. It may be that these aggregators in the future will not need to intermediate the financial transaction, but instead provide directions that lead to direct transfer of funds, through the scheme, from one customer's transaction account to another's.\n13.1 L1P Alignment -- Use by Other FSPs\nThe principles here are, again, low cost and openness. Level One would encourage new players to be able to use and access the scheme, as long as their actions are controlled by the scheme in order to ensure safety and financial stability.\n14. Choice: Scheme Risk Management Standards\nPayments schemes, their platforms, and participating DFSPs and third parties all, obviously, need to operate according to strong risk management standards in order to ensure a healthy payments system ecosystem.\nThe question for a scheme is the balance between defining these standards itself and relying on other standards. From a Business Rules perspective, this is a significant choice. Schemes may either:\n\nDevelop detailed risk management standards for DFSPs (and for the Platform) and conduct rigorous certification and/or audit processes to ensure compliance\n\nRequire DFSPs, the Platform and third parties to follow referenced national or global standards for risk management and security\n\n\n14.1 L1P Alignment- Risk Management Standards\nThe Level One does not address which choice above is the better. But the concepts of a safe system for consumers to use, and a low-cost system clearly apply here. Some considerations:\n\nA shared fraud management utility (which Level One principles do support) can cost-effectively handle some of the tasks of fraud management. This does not reduce an individual DFSP's compliance burden, but merely shifts how it meets that burden\n\nThe global card networks have effectively demonstrated the ability to automate elements of exception processing, focusing on those transactions which occur the most often\n\nThe Mojaloop community has expressed interest in codifying exceptions, and providing support through code for some processes\n\nThe Mojaloop community may also develop best practices documents for handling areas of risk management, including cybersecurity\n\n\n15. Choice: Exception Management\nException processing includes a wide variety of non-standard transactions and interactions among users and providers of a payment scheme. These include:\n\nErrors on the part of end-users\n\nErrors on the part of DFSPs, the Platform, or other FSPs\n\nFraud committed by end-user customers, including individuals,\n  merchants, billers, or other entities\n\nFraud committed by third parties, including hackers\n\nMalicious attacks on the system or on individual DFPSs, including cyber-attacks.\n\n\nSchemes have important choices to make about how involved the scheme, and its Business Rules, are in defining how scheme participants handle these exceptions. Legacy payment systems show us a wide variety of models which are used, from systems where the scheme and Business Rules have minimal involvement in handling of exception processing (checking, most ACH systems) to systems where the scheme and its Business Rules are extensively involved (most card networks). Real-time retail payment systems worldwide are generally only in the early stages of deciding on how to handle these matters.\n15.1 L1P Alignment -- Exception Processing\nThere are two very important Level One design principles that relate to this.\n\nOne is the principle of transaction irrevocability. This means that a payment transaction that is successfully completed (in a Mojaloop implementation, one that has been fulfilled) may not be reversed without the consent of the payee.\n\nThe other is the commitment to a shared fraud management resource at the platform level. The idea is that the scheme and its platform will have a larger view of all transaction data and will be able to perform fraud detection and management tasks more effectively and at a lower cost than can individual DFSPs. This concept is in its very early stage of evolution as Level One systems are deployed, both with and without Mojaloop technology.\n\n\nSchemes will face significant challenges in this area as the long-anticipated rollout of merchant payments occurs, particularly in lesser developed markets that do not have highly penetrated card payments industries. The challenge will be to balance the desire to protect consumers from merchant fraud with the desire to have low-cost end-user pricing. In developed card payments markets, this is often provided by business rules which specify that a merchant's bank is responsible financially for fraud committed by the merchant. This works but results in relatively high transaction charges to the merchant, as their bank must cover their risk exposure under these rules. This financial model may or may not be sustainable in less developed economies. This is another are where we anticipate extensive evolution over the coming years.\n"},"documents/scheme-participation-agreement.html":{"url":"documents/scheme-participation-agreement.html","title":"Scheme Participation Agreement","keywords":"","body":"Scheme Participation Agreement Template\n\n\n\nVersion\nAuthor\nDate\nChange Description\n\n\n\n\n3.0\nCarol Coye Benson (Glenbrook)\nOctober 2019\n\n\n\nAbout the Mojaloop Community Business Document Project\nThis document is part of the Mojaloop Community Business Document Project.

The project is intended to support entities (countries, regions, associations of providers or commercial enterprises) implementing new payments systems using Mojaloop code. These entities will also need write Business Rules that participants in the system will follow.\nThe Mojaloop Community Business Document Project provides templates for Business Rules and related documents. There are many choices involved in implementing a new payment system: the templates show some of the choices and, where appropriate, commentary is provided on how the particular choice is related to the goals of a Level One aligned system.\nThe following documents are part of the project:\n\nScheme Key Choices\n\nScheme Participation Agreement Template\n\nScheme Business Rules Template\n\nPlatform Operating Guideline Template\n\nException Management Operating Guideline Template\n\nUniform Glossary\n\n\nIntroduction\nThis is a glossary of terms used in the Mojaloop Business Community Document Project, and contains other terms related to business topics.
